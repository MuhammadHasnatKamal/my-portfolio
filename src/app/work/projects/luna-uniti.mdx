## Overview

Development of a blockchain-based system that ensures secure, transparent, and decentralized handling of digital transactions and records. The platform combines Flask for backend APIs, React.js for a responsive front-end, and PostgreSQL for reliable data storage.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Transaction Management**: Facilitates secure transactions using blockchain principles, ensuring transparency and immutability.
- **User Dashboard**: Interactive front-end for users to monitor their transactions and blockchain activity.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Supports programmable rules and automated workflows for transactions.
- **Secure Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control for users and administrators.
- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of blockchain activity and system metrics.
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all actions to ensure accountability and traceability.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Python-based backend framework for building secure APIs and handling blockchain logic.
- **React.js**: Front-end library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for structured and reliable data storage.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was ensuring secure communication between the blockchain layer and the user interface while maintaining performance. Another challenge involved designing scalable database schemas that could track blockchain transactions efficiently. The project strengthened skills in decentralized system design, API integration, and real-time data handling.

## Outcome

The platform was successfully completed in **December 2023**, providing a secure and transparent blockchain solution. It enabled users to interact confidently with decentralized transactions, improving trust, accountability, and operational efficiency.
