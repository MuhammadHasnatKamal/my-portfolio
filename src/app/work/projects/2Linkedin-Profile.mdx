## Overview

Development of a secure and user-friendly Evidence Management System that enables individuals to upload, organize, and securely transfer digital evidence to law enforcement agencies. The system streamlines the process of reporting incidents and improves communication between citizens and police departments.

## Key Features

- **Evidence Upload & Management**: Users can upload images, videos, documents, and audio files, and organize them with titles, descriptions, and timestamps.
- **Secure Submission to Police**: Allows users to securely send evidence to registered police departments for official review.
- **Police Dashboard**: A dedicated interface for police officers to view, filter, and manage submitted evidence.
- **User–Police Communication**: Built-in messaging system that allows police to contact users for additional information or clarification.
- **Access Control & Permissions**: Role-based access control for users and police staff to ensure data privacy and system security.
- **Audit Logs**: Tracks all actions performed within the system for transparency and accountability.

## Technologies Used

- **Django**: Backend framework for building secure and scalable server-side logic.
- **JavaScript**: Used for interactive front-end behavior and client-side validations.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight relational database used for storing users, evidence records, and activity logs.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for building a responsive and modern user interface.
- **jQuery**: Used for AJAX-based interactions and dynamic UI updates.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was handling secure file uploads and ensuring the privacy of sensitive evidence. This was addressed by implementing proper file validation, encryption strategies, and strict access control. Another key learning was designing workflows that balance user ease-of-use with the procedural requirements of law enforcement operations.

## Outcome

The system successfully streamlined the process of evidence submission and review, reducing manual handling and improving response times. It enhanced cooperation between the public and law enforcement, while maintaining strong data security and system reliability.
