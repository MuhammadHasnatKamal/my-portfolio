## Overview

Development of a real-time school run tracker designed to manage school vehicle routes, driver assignments, and student pickups efficiently. The platform functions similarly to a taxi dispatch system, providing live location tracking, route optimization, and communication between drivers and school administrators.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Vehicle Tracking**: Monitor school vehicle locations live using GPS integration.
- **Route Management & Optimization**: Dynamically assign routes to drivers and optimize paths for timely pickups.
- **Student & Driver Management**: Maintain records of students, drivers, and pickup/drop-off schedules.
- **Notifications & Alerts**: Automatic alerts to parents and school admins for arrival, delays, or route changes.
- **Mapping Integration**: Uses Google Maps and HERE Maps APIs for accurate navigation and geolocation.
- **Backend Task Automation**: Celery for background tasks like sending notifications and updating routes in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Backend API framework for building secure and scalable endpoints.
- **React.js & Next.js**: Front-end frameworks for interactive dashboards and real-time UI updates.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing student, driver, and route data.
- **Firebase**: Real-time database and push notification service.
- **Redis**: For caching and managing background tasks efficiently.
- **AWS & Render**: Cloud hosting and deployment infrastructure.
- **Google Maps & HERE Maps**: For mapping, routing, and geolocation services.
- **Celery**: Task queue for handling background jobs like notifications and route calculations.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was achieving real-time tracking with minimal latency while handling multiple vehicles and routes simultaneously. Integrating multiple mapping services and managing background tasks with Celery required careful orchestration. This project strengthened skills in real-time system design, scalable backend architecture, and cloud deployment.

## Outcome

The platform was successfully completed in **September 2025**, providing schools with a reliable solution to monitor and manage their vehicle operations. It improved route efficiency, enhanced communication between drivers and administrators, and increased overall safety and transparency for students and parents.
